    LSCF - Least-Squares Complex frequency domain method

    The LSCF method is an frequency-domain Linear Least Squares
    estimator optimized  for modal parameter estimation. The choice of
    the most important algorithm characteristics is based on the
    results in [1] (Section 5.3.3.) and can be summarized as:

        - Formulation: the normal equations [1]
          (Eq. 5.26: [sum(Tk - Sk.H * Rk^-1 * Sk)]*ThetaA=D*ThetaA = 0)
          are constructed for the common denominator discrete-time
          model in the Z-domain. Consequently, by looping over the
          outputs and inputs, the submatrices Rk, Sk, and Tk are
          formulated through the use of the FFT algorithm as Toeplitz
          structured (n+1) square matrices. Using complex coefficients,
          the FRF data within the frequency band of interest (FRF-zoom)
          is projected in the Z-domain in the interval of [0, 2*pi] in
          order to improve numerical conditioning. (In the case that
          real coefficients are used, the data is projected in the
          interval of [0, pi].) The projecting on an interval that does
          not completely describe the unity circle, say [0, alpha*2*pi]
          where alpha is typically 0.9-0.95. Deliberately over-modeling
          is best applied to cope with discontinuities. This is
          justified by the use of a discrete time model in the Z-domain,
          which is much more robust for a high order of the transfer
          function polynomials.

        - Solver: the normal equations can be solved for the
          denominator coefficients ThetaA by computing the Least-Squares
          (LS) or mixed Total-Least-Squares (TLS) solution. The inverse
          of the square matrix D for the LS solution is computed by
          means of a pseudo inverse operation for reasons of numerical
          stability, while the mixed LS-TLS solution is computed using
          an SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).
